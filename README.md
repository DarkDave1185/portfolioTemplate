# portfolioTemplate

Created three different pages for basic portfolio website. Each page has a responsive layout design for different veiwing. The layout for each page is minimal so the viewer  can easily remeber accessing the website. The distictive layout is meant to grasp the viewers attention and also make the user curious for what else might be on the website.

## indexCanvas-

An intoduction page for aesthetic. I attempted an eye cathing animation. I used CSS and JS and GSAP. The canvas element was abit difficult to grasp for this paticular animation. Had to research quite a few terms and methods.

## aboutME-

The pages design is set up for viewers main focus to be directed towards the page content. The information provided on this page is about the creator. It has background information and goals 

## myPortfolio-
The content on this page is of some basic concept art for Halloween costumes. The other design is a conceptual piece based on the mythology of the World Turtle.

## contactMe-
This page is not active to send/recieve messages. The layout is setup to go to "production". You have the option to fill out your name, your email contact, and a brief message of what the contact if for. 

## Used-

*Bootstrap & Flexbox & GSAP||
