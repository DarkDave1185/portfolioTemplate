            David G.S. Dawkins (born November 11, 1985), commonly known as Dave (nickname D.G.), is an Jamaican-American programmer, artist, videogame enthusiast from Englewood, New Jersey. Currently residing in Tucson, Arizona with hopes of landing a career as a programmer in the coming months. Dave grew up with two sister one older by 3 years and the other yonger by one. At the age of 10 his parent realized his artistic and creative passions and enrolled him in art classes and graphic classes. Once finished with high school, graduating in the top 25 students of his class, he persued college at The Art Institute of Philadelphia. After receiving a few awards and nominations for projects in his 2 year tenure his financial situation resulted in him leaving college and moving to Arizona. Once settled in his new locale he freelanced as an artist while working part-time. After a year or two he switched to full-time employment in an attempt to better his life and one day purchase a home. Dave now resides in his newly constructed home working on his next step in life. He currently is attending bootcamp schooling to change his career and better himself and his girlfriend's life. He is really enthused to be learning something new and is very optomistic as to the changes these choices will make on his life.
